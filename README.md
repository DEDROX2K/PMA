## 📖 About The Project

In an age where nearly every productivity tool requires an account, a subscription, and uploading your data to a remote server, **AIR-PASTE** was born out of a desire for simplicity and privacy.

AIR-PASTE is a streamlined project management application built for individuals who want to organize their tasks without compromising ownership of their data. It runs entirely on your local machine. There are no logins, no cloud syncing, and absolutely zero data tracking.

### ✨ Key Features

* **🔒 Privacy First:** No tracking, no telemetry, and no data ever leaves your local drive.
* **🏠 Truly Local:** Runs completely offline. Internet connection not required.
* **💸 Free & Open:** Completely free for everyone to use. The code is open source and transparent.
* **⚡ Modern Interface:** A clean, sleek interface designed to get out of your way so you can focus on the work.
